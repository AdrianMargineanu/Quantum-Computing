## Introduction
  The computer has change a lot seens first apparition. It became smaller and more powerfull. The smaller it becomes, then it is more influenced by [quantum physics](link). This means that if a transistor doesnt allow an electron to go any further, electron can transfer him self by a proces call [quantum tunneling](link). This is happanig beacuse usuall physics is no longer applied in on a quantum scale , this means 100 nanometers. So in '80 was initiated the field of quantum computing. ![image](https://github.com/playerjack/Quantum-Computing/blob/master/mustbe-cantbe.jpg)
  
 ## Qbits
  Usuall computer works on bits, that has 2 basic states. In a quantum computer we have qbits, that can be an electron’s internal angular momentum, or spin, which has the peculiar quantum property of having only two possible projections on any coordinate axis: +1/2 or –1/2 (in units of the [Planck constant](link)). This means you have 2  basic states, as well: ↑ (that can be used as 0) and ↓ (that can be used as 1, because you need energy to make this electron to be in such state). 
  This spin state is described by a formula that includes 2 complex numbers, lets say α and β call [quantum amplitudes](link). The rules of quantum mechanics says that the square of this numbers must add up to 1 and the square of this numbers is the probability of finding this electron in this state. Why probability of finding? Because quantum physics has something called [superposion](link), this means that the electron has both of states at the same time but when you look at it is showing one of them.![image](https://github.com/playerjack/Quantum-Computing/blob/master/mustbe-cantbe.jpg).
   When you have a system of 2 qbits you need 4 complex number ,that square of them must add up to 1. In generally if you have a sistem of N qbits you would 2 power N amplitudes, and this is the power of the quantum camputer. In over words if you have a computer of 64 bits, it is as strong as a quantum computer if 6 qbits.
